What challenges did you face when implementing conditional rendering?

    So, my biggest struggle is piecing things togeter after breaking them up.
    I understand that we are building blocks that can be called on, and instead
    of one big chunk of text. But I'm kind of confused as to why the task would be
    broken up into these three functions instead of one function. And I'm sure there is 
    a good reason, and it doesn't help that the JS task management SBA was also a struggle
    for me. But, yeah, I'm just having a hard time reconstructing the process in my head,
    even though I have been doing small react exercises like rendering lists.

    Also, the typescript ontop of everything resulted in a lot of confusion for me
    in this module.
